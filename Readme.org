#+TITLE: Serial Communication Library
#+AUTHOR: Zach Porter, Erdem Yanikomerolgu

* What is libserial
Libserial was formerly Team 1's mini project that has now been adapted into a serial communication libray for use in your programs. Libserial provides drivers for the 3 communication protocols availables on the KL25Z. Namely UART, I2C, and SPI. Libserial should allow for easy implementation of these protocols without the need to reinventi the wheel again.

Libserial is a Keil project that is set to produce a static library instead of an executable. This should allow for easier implementation into your different programs without having to copy files around.

+ [ ] SPI

* Setup Instructions
The setup instructions assume you have an existing project you wish to implement serial communication in.

** Libserial install and build

1. Clone this repository to your computer. (~git clone https://github.com/zachporter1999/SYSC-4907-mini-proj.git~)
2. Open the library project and build it.

The Library setup is finished. Now lets setup your existing Keil to link this library in at compile time.

** Setting up the include path to libserial's headers

1. In your existing project, under "~Options for Target 1 >> C/C++ (AC6) >> Include Paths~" add the ralative path to the "~libserial//inc~" diretory

** Linking the libserial to project

1. In the project window at the left side of the Keil IDE, right click on the "~Target 1~" folder and add a new group.
2. Rename this new group/folder to lib.
3. right click on the "~lib~" folder, add existing item, and add the "~libserial//Objects//libserial.lib~"

In order to use this library in your code you will need to include the appropriate header files.

#+begin_src c
#include <MKL25Z.h>

// Include libserial headers
#include "drivers/uart.h"
#include "drivers/i2c.h"
#include "drivers/spi.h"

int main() {

  // Main code here

}
#+end_src
