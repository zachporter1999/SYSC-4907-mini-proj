#+TITLE: Serial Communication Library
#+AUTHOR: Zach Porter, Erdem Yanikomerolgu

* Purpose
This serial communication library, formerly Team 1's mini project, is intended to provide a easy to implement interface to interact with UART, I2C, and SPI devices.

** Currently Implemented Drivers
+ [ ] UART
+ [ ] I2C
+ [ ] SPI

* Setup Instructions
The setup instructions assume you have an existing project you wish to implement serial communication in.

1. Clone this repository to your computer. (~git clone https://github.com/zachporter1999/SYSC-4907-mini-proj.git~)
2. Open the library project and build it.
3. In your existing project, under "~Options for Target 1 >> C/C++ (AC6) >> Include Paths~" add the ralative path to the "~libserial//inc~" diretory

4. In the project window at the left side of the Keil IDE, right click on the "~Target 1~" folder and add a new group.
5. Rename this new group/folder to lib.
6. right click on the "~lib~" folder, add existing item, and add the "~libserial//Objects//libserial.lib~"

In order to use this library in your code you will need to include the appropriate header files.

#+begin_src c
#include <MKL25Z.h>

// Include libserial headers
#include "drivers/uart.h"
#include "drivers/i2c.h"
#include "drivers/spi.h"

int main() {

  // Main code here

}
#+end_src
