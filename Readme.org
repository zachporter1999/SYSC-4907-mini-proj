#+TITLE: Serial Communication Library
#+AUTHOR: Zach Porter, Erdem Yanikomerolgu

* What is libserial
Libserial was formerly Team 1's mini project that has now been adapted into a serial communication libray for use in your programs. Libserial provides drivers for the 3 communication protocols availables on the KL25Z. Namely UART, I2C, and SPI. Libserial should allow for easy implementation of these protocols without the need to reinventi the wheel again.

Libserial is a Keil project that is set to produce a static library instead of an executable. This should allow for easier implementation into your different programs without having to copy files around.

** Currently Implemented Drivers

+ [ ] I2C
+ [ ] SPI

* Setup Instructions
These setup instructions only apply if you are wanting to link libserial to other existing Keil Project. This Repo is already setup to develop and test libserial.

** Libserial install and build

1. Clone this repository to your computer. (~git clone https://github.com/zachporter1999/SYSC-4907-mini-proj.git~)
2. Open the library project and build it.

The Library setup is finished. Now lets setup your existing Keil to link this library in at compile time.

** Setting up the include path to libserial's headers

1. In your existing project, under "~Options for Target 1 >> C/C++ (AC6) >> Include Paths~" add the ralative path to the "~libserial//inc~" diretory

** Linking the libserial to project

1. In the project window at the left side of the Keil IDE, right click on the "~Target 1~" folder and add a new group.
2. Rename this new group/folder to lib.
3. Right-click on the "~lib~" folder, add existing item, and add the "~libserial//Objects//libserial.lib~"
4. RIght-click on "~lib~" file in the projects lib folder and select the options for that file. Then click select modules and the modules you want.

In order to use this library in your code you will need to include the appropriate header files.

#+begin_src c
#include <MKL25Z.h>

// Include libserial headers
#include "drivers/uart.h"
#include "drivers/i2c.h"
#include "drivers/spi.h"

int main() {

  // Main code here

}
#+end_src
